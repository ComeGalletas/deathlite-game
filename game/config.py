# not once per frame. Armor is a flat per-hit subtraction, so a per-frame slice
# (rate / fps) would be fully absorbed -- see journals/BUG_JOURNAL.md #1. Each
# bite is `rate * interval` before armor, so the pre-armor DPS is unchanged.
# Individual attacks may override this via `contact_interval` (enemies / boss)
# or `hazard_tick` (warlock hazards). Keep `rate * interval` a healthy multiple
# of the largest expected armor, or an armored hero goes immune to that attack:
